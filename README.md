<!-- badges: end -->

R Package designed for mapping various geomorphological and (simple)
vegetation attributes of river corridor. The package is specifically
tailored to the needs of data-scarce environments and the use of
globally available (satellite) data. This initial release includes the
fuzzy logic based delineation of river corridors/riparian zones as
described in [Betz et
al.Â (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.01.024), more
functionality will be added gradually.
